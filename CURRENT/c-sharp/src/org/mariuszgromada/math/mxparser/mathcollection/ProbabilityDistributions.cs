 * COMMERCIAL LICENSE
 *
 *  1. Before purchasing a commercial license, AUTHOR & PUBLISHER allow you
 *     to download, install and use up to three copies of the PRODUCT to
 *     perform integration tests, confirm the quality of the PRODUCT and
 *     its suitability. The testing period should be limited to fourteen
 *     days. Tests should be performed under the conditions of test
 *     environments. The purpose of the tests must not be to generate profit.
 *  2. Provided that you purchased a license from "INFIMA" online store
 *     (store address: https://mathparser.org/order-commercial-license or
 *     https://payhip.com/infima), and you comply with all below terms and
 *     conditions, and you have acknowledged and understood the following
 *     DISCLAIMER, AUTHOR & PUBLISHER grant you a nonexclusive license
 *     including the following rights:
 *  3. The license has been granted only to you, i.e., the person or entity
 *     that made the purchase, who is identified and confirmed by the data
 *     provided during the purchase.
 *  4. In case you purchased a license in the "ONE-TIME PURCHASE" model,
 *     the license has been granted only for the PRODUCT version specified
 *     in the purchase. The upgrade policy gives you additional rights and
 *     is described in the dedicated section below.
 *  5. In case you purchased a license in the "SUBSCRIPTION" model, you can
 *     install and use any version of the PRODUCT, but only during the
 *     subscription validity period.
 *  6. In case you purchased a "SINGLE LICENSE" you can install and use the
 *     PRODUCT from one workstation.
 *  7. Additional copies of the PRODUCT can be installed and used from more
 *     than one workstation; however, this number is limited to the number
 *     of workstations purchased as per order.
 *  8. In case you purchased a "SITE LICENSE ", the PRODUCT can be installed
 *     and used from all workstations located at your premises.
 *  9. You may incorporate the unmodified PRODUCT into your own products
 *     and software.
 * 10. If you purchased a license with the "SOURCE CODE" option, you may
 *     modify the PRODUCT's source code and incorporate the modified source
 *     code into your own products and/or software.
 * 11. Provided that the license validity period has not expired, you may
 *     distribute your product and/or software with the incorporated
 *     PRODUCT royalty-free.
 * 12. You may make copies of the PRODUCT for backup and archival purposes.

 *
 * ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION ON WORKSTATION
 *
 * A workstation is a device, a remote device, or a virtual device, used by
 * you, your employees, or other entities to whom you have commissioned the
 * tasks. For example, the number of workstations may refer to the number
 * of software developers, engineers, architects, scientists, and other
 * professionals who use the PRODUCT on your behalf. The number of
 * workstations is not the number of copies of your end-product that you
 * distribute to your end-users.
 *
 * By purchasing the COMMERCIAL LICENSE, you only pay for the number of
 * workstations, while the number of copies of your final product
 * (delivered to your end-users) is not limited.
 *
 * UPGRADE POLICY
 *
 * The PRODUCT is versioned according to the following convention:
 *
 *    [MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]
 *
 * 1. COMMERCIAL LICENSE holders can install and use the updated version
 *    for bug fixes free of charge, i.e. if you have purchased a license
 *    for the [MAJOR].[MINOR] version (e.g.: 5.0), you can freely install
 *    all the various releases specified in the [PATCH] version (e.g.: 5.0.2).
 *    The license terms remain unchanged after the update.
 * 2. COMMERCIAL LICENSE holders for [MAJOR].[MINOR] version (e.g.: 5.0)
 *    can install and use the updated version [MAJOR].[MINOR + 1] free of
 *    charge, i.e., plus one release in the [MINOR] range (e.g.: 5.1). The
 *    license terms remain unchanged after the update.
 * 3. COMMERCIAL LICENSE holders who wish to upgrade their version, but are
 *    not eligible for the free upgrade, can claim a discount when
 *    purchasing the upgrade. For this purpose, please contact us via e-mail.
