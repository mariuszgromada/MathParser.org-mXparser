/**
 * FunctionExtension provides interface for function algorithm definition.
 * In this case algorithm definition is based on source code using
 * JAVA (for JAVA / Android) or .NET. If implemented Function Extension
 * object can be further used while Function object
 * construction, which means it can extend mXparser math collection.
 * mXparser extension with your own implementation can be achieved
 * by implementing FunctionExtension interface, creating an FunctionExtension
 * object, creating Function object based on FunctionExtension, adding Function
 * object to Expression / mXparser definition.
